# ProXFont Files

This repository contains the binary font files for **ProXFont**, which are served through the ProXFont platform ([proxfont.com](https://proxfont.com)).

The top-level directories represent the license of all files within them. Subdirectories are named after the font family they contain.

Each family subdirectory contains:
- `.ttf` font files served by ProXFont.
- A `METADATA.pb` file with family information (designer(s), genre category, license, etc. - [learn more](https://github.com/ProgrammerKR/proxfonts/gf-docs/tree/master/METADATA)).
- A `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html` file with a description of the font family in US English.

The `/catalog` subdirectory contains additional metadata such as profile texts and images of font designers. This is open for contributions and corrections from anyone via GitHub.

The `/axisregistry` subtree contains metadata for the ProXFont Axis Registry, which includes information about variable font axes in the collection, including experimental axes. Please note that no changes should be made directly to this repository; instead, contribute to the upstream repository at [github.com/proxfonts/axisregistry](https://github.com/proxfonts/axisregistry).

The `/lang` subtree includes language support data. Please contribute any modifications upstream at [github.com/proxfonts/lang](https://github.com/proxfonts/lang).
